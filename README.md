# Overview
This project presents a set of libraries, each of which is related to the implementation of a specific data structure.

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Simone Catapano (Naples, Italy) and by the time I am writing this I am 21 years old. <br />
I am a computer science student currently studying at the University of Naples Federico II.

## Quick explanation of the project
The project I am showing you is a grouping of all the tests (five) that I have carried out for the examination of algorithms and data structures. <br />
I wrote some sample code to show what my library is capable of (the example is for HashTables 'cause It is the one I cared the most about). <br />
The whole project was developed in Linux environment (Linux Mint and Ubuntu).

## Tutorial: Code your personal test
I provided for you an entire folder dedicated to your personal test. <br />
In __user-test/usertest.hpp__ there is everything you'll need, including all the libraries. <br />
Your code has to be written inside the namespace at __user-test/usertest.cpp__. Have fun! <br />

### Compile and Execute your code in Linux
```sh
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
cd bin
./main # Press '3' If you want to run your personal test!
```
