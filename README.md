# OVERVIEW
This project presents a set of libraries, each of which is related to the implementation of a specific data structure.

# INTRODUCTION
Hello! My name is Simone Catapano (Naples, Italy) and by the time I am writing this I am 20 years old.
If you haven't read my bio, know that I am a computer science student at the University of Naples Federico II.

# QUICK EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT
The project I am showing you is a grouping of all the tests (five) that I have carried out for the examination of algorithms and data structures.
You can find all the code in the master branch and, I also wrote some sample code to show what my library is capable of (the example is for Hash Tables just because my professor cared a lot about this specific library).
The whole project has been developed in Linux environment (Linux Mint) and with the command "./build.sh" you can compile and run the code on the command line ( to execute the library test write "./main" in the command line ).
