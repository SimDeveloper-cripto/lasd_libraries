# OVERVIEW
This project presents a set of libraries, each of which is related to the implementation of a specific data structure.

## INTRODUCTION
Hello! My name is Simone Catapano (Naples, Italy) and by the time I am writing this I am 21 years old. <br />
If you haven't read my bio, know that I am a computer science student currently studying at the University of Naples Federico II.

## QUICK EXPLANATION OF THE PROJECT
The project I am showing you is a grouping of all the tests (five) that I have carried out for the examination of algorithms and data structures. <br />
You can find all the code in the master branch and, I also wrote some sample code to show what my library is capable of (the example is for Hash Tables just because my professor cared a lot about this specific library). <br />
The whole project has been developed in Linux environment (Linux Mint 21 Cinnamon).

### Test the library
```console
$ chmod +x build.sh
$ ./build.sh
$ ./main
```
